Gi√∏n 0.0.4

A Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) icon set for GNOME Desktop.

Please, please do not judge this icon set for its completeness, this
is a work in progress which still has a long way to go. For this icon set
I've decided not to produce as many icons as I can, instead I want
to produce a really high quality theme, which will take a lot of time and
effort.

On a side note, donations are always welcome. School -and work- are  
taking alot of time from me which I would love to spend on making icons 
for the GNU/Linux and GNOME comunities. For more information check 
the DONATE file included in the icon set package.
